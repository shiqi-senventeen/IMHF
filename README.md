# Integrated Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion and Meta-Learning for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction

This repository contains the complete code and necessary CSV files for our paper *"Integrated Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion and Meta-Learning for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction."* Our approach integrates molecular graphs and images using a multimodal hierarchical fusion framework combined with meta-learning to improve molecular property prediction performance.

Due to storage constraints, only a small sample of molecular images is included here. However, all remaining molecular images, SMILES datasets, and pretrained model weights are available for download via the following cloud storage links:
