# Integrated Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion and Meta-Learning for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction
This repository contains the complete code and all required CSV files for our paper "Integrated Multimodal Hierarchical Fusion and Meta-Learning for Enhanced Molecular Property Prediction." The project integrates molecular graphs and molecular images through a multimodal fusion framework combined with meta-learning to improve molecular property prediction. Due to storage limitations, only a small sample of molecular images is included in this repository as examples. All other data and code are provided to ensure full reproducibility of the experiments.
In addition to the code and sample data provided in this repository, all molecular images, SMILES datasets, and pretrained model weights have been uploaded to both Baidu Netdisk and Google Drive for your convenience. Please feel free to access and download them as needed using the links provided in the documentation.
